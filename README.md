# Bioengineering_Graduation_Project
My research focus on genome anlysis from raw data, my related work is downloaded sequences and performed the bioinformatic analysis. My data collected from data of 11 *Acinetobacter baumanii* strains were islated from Phu Tho Hospital, Viet Nam. The project accession number is PRJEB43552.
